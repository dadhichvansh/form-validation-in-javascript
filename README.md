# Form Validation using JavaScript

This project demonstrates a simple form validation system using JavaScript. The form includes fields for username, email, password, and confirm password. Each field is validated in real-time to ensure that the user inputs meet the required criteria. The project uses modern JavaScript (ES6+) and CSS for styling.

## Features:

- Real-time Validation: The form validates user input as they type or when they move to the next field.
- Error Messages: Clear and concise error messages are displayed if the input does not meet the validation criteria.
- Success Indicators: Input fields are highlighted with a green border when the input is valid.

## Validation Rules:

- Username:
    - Must not be empty.
    - Must be at least 3 characters long.
- Email:
    - Must not be empty.
    - Must be a valid email address.
- Password:
    - Must not be empty.
    - Must be at least 8 characters long.
- Confirm Password:
    - Must not be empty.
    - Must match the password field.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML: For structuring the form.
- CSS: For styling the form and error messages.
- JavaScript (ES6+): For handling form validation logic.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Run Live Server or a similar development server to view the project in your browser.
3. Fill out the form fields and observe the validation in action.
4. If all fields are valid, the form will submit successfully, and a success message will be logged in the console.

- **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the form and error messages.
